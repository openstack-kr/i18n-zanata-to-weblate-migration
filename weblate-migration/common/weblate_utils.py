        check_sentence_detail already flags whether Zanata and Weblate
        msgstr differ, but not why a difference matters. A placeholder
        (%s, %(name)s, {name}, ...) dropped or mangled during
        migration still counts as "translated", but breaks string
        formatting at runtime - a much higher-severity class of
        mismatch than a wording difference. For entries whose source
        (msgid/msgid_plural) contains at least one placeholder, this
        compares the placeholder set actually present in the Zanata
        translation against the one in the Weblate translation and
        fails if they differ, isolating that specific failure mode
        out of check_sentence_detail's generic mismatch signal.

        This deliberately compares Zanata's translation directly to
        Weblate's, not each side to the English source: gettext plural
        rules mean a language can have a different number of plural
        forms than the two (singular/plural) English source strings,
        so there is no reliable way to say which of msgid/msgid_plural
        a given translated form "should" match. Comparing Zanata to
        Weblate at the same plural index sidesteps that ambiguity
        entirely and stays consistent with this project's baseline:
        Zanata is the source of truth Weblate must match, for
        placeholders exactly as for everything else check_sentence_*
        already compares.
