#   - migration_resources.sh sources this directly, so when it's run
#     standalone in an interactive shell, IS_TTY reflects that; when
#     it's run as `migration_resources.sh ... | while read line; do
#     ... done` (as migration_projects.sh does), its stdout is a pipe,
#     so IS_TTY is correctly 0 there even though a human may be
#     watching migration_projects.sh's own terminal.
#   - migration_projects.sh sources this too, and checks IS_TTY in its
#     *own* process, which is the process actually connected to the
#     user's terminal (or to a log file, if the whole batch run itself
#     was redirected/piped by the caller).

# [ERROR] trail is project.log-only. Without this, a bare

# component/locale, and isn't written to project.log/error.log at
# all), and re-coloring a $plain_line that migration_resources.sh's
# process already tagged in full - tagging either here would add a
# spurious second "- | - | " (migration_projects.sh never touches

# --- Live console tree (phase 2) ---------------------------------
#
# migration_projects.sh's live console used to echo every tagged line
# verbatim - the same density for a locale that succeeded in one
# request as one that took 3 retries and failed. create_weblate_components.sh
# now instead builds a compressed project/category -> component ->
# locale tree (success collapsed to one line, only failures expand),
# while project.log/error.log keep the full detail from phase 1
# unchanged. Since the child process (migration_resources.sh) and the
# parent (migration_projects.sh) only share one pipe, the child tags
# each line with one of the two markers below so the parent knows
# what to do with it - see phase-2-console-tree.md for the full
# design.

# A line already fully formatted for the live console (built by
# tree_line() below) - the parent prints it as-is (after stripping the
# marker) instead of tagging it and appending it to project.log. This
# is a compressed *view* over facts already recorded via
# log()/tagged_colorize()/run_tagged_quiet(), not new information, so
# it deliberately doesn't also go to the log file.
TREE_MARKER="##TREE## "

# A line tagged and meant for project.log/error.log only (phase 1
# behavior), but that the parent should NOT echo to the live console -
# create_weblate_components.sh's per-locale steps use this instead of
# log()/run_tagged()/tagged_colorize(), since the console now shows
# only the compressed tree built from tree_line() calls. Other stages
# keep using log()/run_tagged() unchanged, so their console output is
# unaffected by phase 2.
QUIET_MARKER="##QUIET## "

# A tree line that replaces the immediately preceding tree line on a
# real terminal (e.g. "⏳ 환경설정 진행중..." -> "✓ 환경설정 완료" on
# the same row, or a live "N/total done" counter updating locale by
# locale), instead of appending a new one - migration_projects.sh only
# does this when its own stdout is a TTY (see colorize()'s IS_TTY,
# same reasoning: an ANSI cursor-up/clear-line sequence is meaningless
# - and corrupts the byte stream - when stdout is redirected to a file
# or captured by another process). When not a TTY, the parent instead
# *buffers* the update (see pending_tree_update in migration_projects.sh)
# and only prints the last one in a chain, right before the next
# non-update line needs to reach the console (or at the very end of
# the stream) - so a long run of per-locale updates still collapses to
# one line there too, just without the live redraw. A call site only
# needs an immediately preceding tree_line()/tree_line_update() to
# replace - chains of any length work the same way on both paths.
TREE_UPDATE_MARKER="##TREE_UPDATE## "

# Print $1 as a ready-to-display tree line - see TREE_MARKER above.

# component with many locales isn't silent for the many minutes it
# can take (each locale is an API round-trip, sometimes with retry
# sleeps) between its "⏳ 컴포넌트 생성 진행중..." header and the one
# tree line that used to appear only once every locale in it was

#   - Stage 04 (create_weblate_components.sh) Weblate REST API

#     _retry_on_status leaves in the raw line (e.g.
#     {"errors":[{"code":"invalid","detail":"..."}]}). The console
#     tree used to show only "<status> <code>" (e.g. "400 invalid"),
#     which collapses several unrelated root causes into one string.
#   - Stage 05 (05-test-accuracy/test.sh) check_* accuracy-check
#     failures: these never go through _retry_on_status (no HTTP
#     status/JSON code at all), so before this function existed they
#     always fell through to the plain 60-char truncation below -
#     worse than Stage 04's problem, since not even which check failed
#     was visible.
# Returns empty (no match) rather than guessing, so an unrecognized
# pattern falls through to the code/truncation fallback below instead
# of being silently mis-labeled - add a new case here once a real log
# shows the pattern (this is the "whitelist + fallback" design from
