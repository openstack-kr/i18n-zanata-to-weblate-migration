  - logs/summary.tsv, the per (project, version) run verdict that
    migration_projects.sh appends to on every run (completed_at,
    project, version, exit_code, run_id, started_at).
  - <workspace>/projects/<project>/result.jsonl, the per (project,

    common/weblate_utils.py appends (see migration-status-tracking
    Phase 2 and Phase 5), folded into one merged entry per key by
    common.weblate_utils.reduce_result_events().
  - logs/<project>/project.<run_id>.log, to classify *where* a failed
    run stopped (clone / POT generation / Weblate component creation
    / accuracy check), by finding the last stage marker
    migration_resources.sh printed for that version before it exited
    (most stages via pretty-printer.sh's stage(), which prints
    "# <title>"; env_check is a plain "[INFO] <text>" line since it
    isn't wrapped in stage()/endstage()).

Prints a project x version x component x locale status table (or CSV)
so "how far did the migration get, and where did it fail" can be
answered without opening every logs/<project>/error.*.log by hand.
