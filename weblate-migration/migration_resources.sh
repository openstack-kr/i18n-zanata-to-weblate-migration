# NOTE: POT generation (setup_*, which writes zanata.xml) and the Zanata
# export (pull_translation_files) are kept in a single stage here rather
# than split into two, because get_django_component_names/
# get_doc_component_names (used by the default `*` branch below) detect
# components by checking for .pot files that pull_translation_files
# writes - they only exist *after* the Zanata pull runs. Splitting this
# into separate top-level stages would require either reordering the
# pull ahead of POT-based component detection (breaking it for the
# default branch) or duplicating stage/endstage inside all seven case
# arms; both are out of scope for this consistency-only change. See
# phase-1 result doc for details.
